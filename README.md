# JS Chat

This is a simple chat application built using Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, HTML, and CSS. It serves as a beginner project to learn and implement key concepts in web development, particularly focusing on Express, Socket.io, and Node.js.

## Features

- **Real-Time Communication:** Utilizes Socket.io for real-time bidirectional event-based communication between the server and clients.

- **Typing Indicator:** Implemented a feature to show other users when someone is typing, enhancing the user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime that allows server-side execution of JavaScript.

- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js, simplifying the development of web applications.

- **Socket.io:** A library for real-time web applications, enabling real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.

- **HTML and CSS:** Used for creating the frontend structure and styling of the chat application.

## Getting Started

## Future Improvements

As a beginner project, there are plans for future improvements and learning. Some areas to focus on include:

- **Enhanced User Interface:** Improve the design and layout of the chat application for a more appealing user experience.

- **Additional Features:** Explore and implement more features such as message history, private messaging, user authentication, etc.
